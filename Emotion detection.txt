In order to develop a model which could predict the person's emotion using face image, following procedure could be followed:
1. Download a image dataset of human's emotion using face image
2. Using tensorflow, build a neural network model of image classification.
3. Divide the dataset into two types: Training data and testing data.
4. Reshaping all the training images into a specific size and putting it into the model to train the model.
5. Tuning the hyperparameters of the model to improve the accuracy.
6. After a satisfying accuracy, save the model.
7. Then testing the model on the test data.
8. Some tuning of the hyperparameters can be done if required.
9. Take the image input and our model will predict the emotion.
10. Our model is ready.
